<h1>I. What drives the homogenization/heterogenization of music?</h1>
<p>In the previous notebook (check_horkheimer), I found that while Horkheimer was right in that different and successful songs had many imitators, there was not strong evidence that genres became more specific as time went on.</p>
<p>Instead of Horkheimer’s theory of homogenization, I propose that there is a constant cycle of homogenization and heterogenization of music as a result of the constant tension between the dominant culture and subcultures. My general framework for understanding this tension comes from Hebdige’s <em>Subculture: The Meaning of Style</em>. What specific trends catch on depends on the circuit of production, similar to the design of the Sony Walkman as outlined by DuGay et. al.&nbsp;in Chapter 2 of <em>Doing Cultural Studies</em>. The pattern of how trends spread follows the pattern of complex contagions, as described by Guilbeault et al in “Complex Contagions: A Decade in Review”. Throughout this explanation, I compare how it differs from Horkheimer.</p>
<!-- Hebdige -->
<p>In <em>Subcultures: The Meaning of Style</em>, Hebdige criticizes how structural Marxism explains the reproduction of structures, but has no explanation for change. Hebdige defines style in subculture as gestures that challenge the cohesion of dominant culture. He uses the punk aesthetic as an example of a subculture that represented the white working class British youth as a response to the social unease in the post-war period. Out of objects such as safety pins, which were used to hold clothes together, it created “tokens of a self-imposed exile” (Hebdige 2). However, the image of social cohesion is maintained through the appropriation and redefinition of cultures of resistance. Thus, punk style was commodified and labelled as both trivial and a spectacle: “Youth cultural styles may begin by issuing symbolic challenges, but they must inevitably end by establishing new sets of conventions” (Hebidge 96).</p>
<p>Thus, my theory agrees with Horkehimer that “anyone who resists can survive only by being incorporated” (Horkheimer 104) through the commodification of subcultures. However, since there is a constant tension between hegemony and subcultures, I disagree that the wheel spins in place. Rather, the wheel travels through subcultures. The process of commodification defuses the subculture’s subversive power, and its innovations are fed back to mainstream culture (Hebidge 95). Thus, as subcultures become part of the mainstream culture, they are influenced by the next subculture, so genres do not converge to a formula.</p>
<!-- duGay -->
<p>Additionally, while Horkheimer believes that culture is produced from the top-down, I argue that it is created and inspired through a bottom-up process. Using the circuit of production to analyze Hebdige reveals this relationship clearly. Before commodification, subcultures originate with oppressed groups, such as the white working class or Black American youth. Signifiers such as safety pins or AAVE are backed-up by the identity of these oppressed groups. Safety pins serve a functional purpose for the working class community, and AAVE comes from the linguistic history of Black Americans. Similar to how the design of the Walkman was limited by the budget of the target audience (DuGay 48), the objects that become sign-vehicles are influenced by the environment of the oppressed group. In the process of commodification, producers interpret the subculture as “cool”, which targets their consumers. Through this exchange, the interpretant of oppressed community is changed to “coolness”, which results in the ideology of the subculture becoming disconnected from the sign-vehicles. Thus, people who don’t come from the working class or historically Black communities adopt signs such as safety pins or AAVE to legitimize their identity as “cool”.</p>
<!-- Guilbeault -->
<p>The process of a subculture to catch on follows the model of a complex contagion, as described by Guilbeault et al in “Complex Contagions: A Decade in Review”. A simple contagion only requires a single activated source for transmission, while complex contagions require multiple sources of activation, such as behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes (Guilbeault 4). Since subcultures are a behavior, they should act like a complex contagion, meaning they grow slowly at first, and then explode.</p>

<h1>III. Analysis</h1>
<p>If my theory is correct, then three legisign relationships should exist.</p>
<p>First, subcultures are commodified when their popularity increases. Hot Topic is a popular company that brands itself as counterculture, and currently lists Classic Rock, Garage, Hip-Hop, K-Pop, Metal, Pop, Pop Punk, Punk, and Screamo in their “Shop by Genre” subdivisions. However, I don’t have access to dates of when these categories were added, so I can’t test this legisign. Instead, I will use their categories as a list of subcultures that have been commodified.</p>
<p>Second, the growth of subcultures should follow the growth of complex contagions. This relationship can be tested by comparing the growth of simulated complex contagions to the number of tracks created in a subculture genre per year. The number of tracks created in a genre is a good measure for the genre’s growth because they represent both how many/how willing artists are to create music in this genre as well as points of transmission. If an artist creates a track of the genre, they have been “infected” with the subculture, and they contribute to the genre by creating a point of transmission. The number of tracks an artist creates also represents how committed they are to this subculture as well as creating multiple points of transmission.</p>
<p>Third, if the wheel moves through subcultures, then, the music of an earlier subculture should become influenced by the music of a newly commodified subculture. This relationship can be tested by creating a basis for each subculture based on numerical Spotify data using the ten years before its commodification. As a proxy for when it was commodified, I’ll use the Spotify Popularity score from above. After creating the basis for each subculture, I can change the basis of all the songs to each subculture’s basis and find the residual. Since the longer the residual, the more different the song is from the genre’s basis, I flip the sign to get a measure of similarity.</p>

<p><em>Releases by Year.</em><br> In this line plot, the number of songs released per year is shown for each of the Hot Topic genres in addition to a simulated complex contagion. They all grow similarly, except for rock, which has been at the maximum since 1950, and garage, which had a significant bump around 1965.</p>

<p><em>Growth of Subgenres vs.&nbsp;Complex Contagion Growth</em>.<br> This line plot shows sets the year the genres first reached about one thousand releases per year to 0, and shows that the genres follow the growth of a complex contagion.

<section id="by-popularity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="by-popularity">By popularity</h3>
<p>Spotify data also has a “popularity” metric. This would not be a good measure to see if the growth of genres follows the pattern of complex contagions, since older songs in a genre can become popular after the genre becomes popular. However, this score could be useful as a proxy for when subcultures have become commodified. According to <a href="https://lodgecove.com/what-is-the-spotify-popularity-index/">this article</a>, a popularity score of 20 is when Spotify suggests the song to people that aren’t following the artist. If the average popularity score for a genre reaches 20, then that’s a good sign that many of the songs released from that year could fit the taste of less counter- more mainstream- listeners.</p>

<p><em>Year vs.&nbsp;Popularity</em>. <br> This line plot graphs the Spotify Popularity Score against release year for each subgenre. At a score of 20, Spotify begins sharing a song with listeners who don’t follow the artist. The order of genres that reached 20 and stayed above 20 is rock, metal, hip-hop, punk, k-pop, emo, anime, and garage.</p>

<p><em>Similarity across genres</em>.<br> Using a PCA reconstruction with each subculture as the basis, I graph the average reconstruction error on the y-axis. While the similarities do increase, there seem to be no relation to the year the subcultures first passed a popularity score of 20.</p>

<section id="iv.-conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>IV. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Through the exploration of Spotify data, I found that the growth of subcultures follows the growth of a compelx contagion. Additionally, I found that all the subcultures that Hot Topic has commodified have followed the growth of a complex contagion. It makes sense that the growth of subcultures is similar to that of a complex contagion, since the commodification of a subculture leads to the aesthetics becoming trendy. The Spotify API only allows 1000 tracks to be pulled for each query, so the dataset’s number of tracks produced within a genre per year was capped at 1000. However, we can still see the characteristic slow start, and extremely quick increase in slope.</p>
<p>However, I did not find strong evidence that the explosion of popularity of the latest subculture influences the previously commodified subcultures to shift towards it. This turned out to be a harder legisign to test than I expected, because there were a lot of questions I was unsure about: should I create a basis based on the formative years of the subculture? Maybe those years aren’t the most representative, though, and the genre might still change before it becomes what it is recognized for. Should I then create a basis for when it became popular? By that point it might have already been commodified, and while I have the Spotify Popularity metric as a proxy for when it was commodified, I don’t have accurate dates. Additionally, even after creating these basis and comparing how the other genres might have been affected, it’s unclear whether the similarity increases because genre A is influenced by genre B, or if there were outside factors. For example, the music in anime realistically does not influence emo or hip-hop music. However, the graph shows that there is a point in time where the anime basis captures more of the variability in the emo and hip-hop music. The increase also does not coincide with the popularity of anime music, so the increase is likely due to another factor. However, with such a large change in average residual distance in a case we know it doesn’t mean anything, then not much can be gleaned from the other graphs. A future analysis could find better dates for commodification, and another method to test this legisign.</p>
<p>After this entire exploration, I can conclude that while I’m unsure why the variation within genres has not decreased, I know that it hasn’t. At a greater level, music in general follows trends that grow from the bottom up, in the manner of a complex contagion.</p>
