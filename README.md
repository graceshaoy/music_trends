# Was Horkheimer right?
In “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deceoption”, Horkheimer and Adorno claim that “Culture today is infecting everything with sameness”.
They argue that while variations do exist, the variation is not true variation – rather, like a wheel spinning in place, it gives the appearance of differentiation, but there ultimately is no true difference. Either the differences are surface level (such as the extravagant use of technology in films) and do not relate to the meaning of the products themselves, or they do not varying from existing styles. Everything is created within the same pre-existing types.

In README_pt1.html, we will evaluate this claim of “sameness” in relation to the popular music industry, using data from the Billboard Hot 100.

# What's going on, then?
In the previous notebook (check_horkheimer), I found that while Horkheimer was right in that different and successful songs had many imitators, there was not strong evidence that genres became more specific as time went on.

Instead of Horkheimer’s theory of homogenization, I propose that there is a constant cycle of homogenization and heterogenization of music as a result of the constant tension between the dominant culture and subcultures. My general framework for understanding this tension comes from Hebdige’s Subculture: The Meaning of Style. What specific trends catch on depends on the circuit of production, similar to the design of the Sony Walkman as outlined by DuGay et. al. in Chapter 2 of Doing Cultural Studies. The pattern of how trends spread follows the pattern of complex contagions, as described by Guilbeault et al in “Complex Contagions: A Decade in Review”. Throughout this explanation, I compare how it differs from Horkheimer.

In README_pt2.html, I explore my claim.
